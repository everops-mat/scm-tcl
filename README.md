# scm-tcl
A simple wrapper around SCM programs to write custom wrappers

I overuse wrapper scripts. Generally because I had trying to 
remember what exact setup a need to do certain things or I hate 
using my shell history to search for something I ran three weeks
ago and forgot to documment. 

After writing a wrapper around git, subversion, hg, fossil, and even
cvs for more years than I would like to admit, I decided to finally 
create a [TCL](http://tcl-lang.org) module that would allow me to 
create opinioned wrappers to easily remember how use a SCM in 
whatever way I'm suppose to for a client, repo, or project I am 
working on.
